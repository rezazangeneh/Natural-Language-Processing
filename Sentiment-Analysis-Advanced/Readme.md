LSTM + Recurrent Neural Network Implementation.
Use of gensim word2vec instead of a simple bag of words.
Training Data was Amazon + Yelp + IMDB reviews labelled as 0 or 1 based on the sentiment.
  + UCI testdata added.

Some tips:
  There are only 2 classes: 0 and 1- 0 being negative sentiment and 1 being the positive.
  Do not use more than 1000-2000 training examples, you will try to overfit the data resulting in poor accuracy. 
  Use more data for testing to get a wholesome idea about the accuracy of the model.
  
Example usage of TensorFlow.  

-Will upload the test unparsed files soon.
